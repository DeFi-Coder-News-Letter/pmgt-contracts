![Perth Mint Gold Token (PMGT)](docs/pmgt_banner.png)

The Perth Mint Gold Token (PMGT) is an ERC20 compliant token, each representing 1 fine troy ounce of physical gold
securely stored in The Perth Mint's central bank grade vaults.

Developed by InfiniGold, the tokens are 100% backed by GoldPass certificates issued by The Perth Mint, the world's
largest refiner of newly mined gold.  Every ounce of gold is guaranteed by the highly rated sovereign entity - the
Government of Western Australia.

See the [PMGT whitepaper](https://pmgt.io/static/assets/pmgt_whitepaper.pdf) for more information.
